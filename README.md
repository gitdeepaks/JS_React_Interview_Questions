# JavaScript and React Interview Questions

## JavaScript Questions

1. **What are the different data types present in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: JavaScript has seven basic data types: `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `string`, `symbol`, `number`, and `object`.

2. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**

   - Answer: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (script or function).

3. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.

4. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: `==` is the abstract equality operator and compares for equality after type coercion. `===` is the strict equality operator and compares values and types without converting.

5. **Explain the use of arrow functions in JavaScript.**
   - Answer: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax and lexically bind the `this` value.

## React Questions

1. **What is React?**

   - Answer: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. **Explain the virtual DOM in React.**

   - Answer: The virtual DOM is a programming concept where an ideal, or "virtual", representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.

3. **What are props in React?**

   - Answer: Props are short for Properties. They are read-only components that must be kept pure.

4. **What is the state in React and how is it used?**

   - Answer: State is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over the lifetime of the component.

5. **What are hooks in React?**
   - Answer: Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Advanced JavaScript Questions

1. **Explain event delegation in JavaScript.**

   - Answer: Event delegation is a technique involving adding an event listener to a parent element instead of adding it to the descendant elements.

2. **What are promises in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

3. **Explain the concept of prototypes in JavaScript.**

   - Answer: Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

4. **What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, despite its single-threaded nature, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

5. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous code?**
   - Answer: JavaScript handles asynchronous code using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Advanced React Questions

1. **Explain the lifecycle methods of a React component.**

   - Answer: React components have several lifecycle methods that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.

2. **What are higher-order components in React?**

   - Answer: A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

3. **Explain the concept of Context in React.**

   - Answer: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

4. **What is Redux and how is it used with React?**

   - Answer: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React for state management.

5. **Explain the use of keys in React lists.**
   - Answer: Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, which aids in efficient update of the user interface.

### Additional JavaScript Questions

6. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to, providing a way to refer to the context in which the current code is executing.

7. **How do JavaScript closures work?**

   - Answer: Closures are functions that remember their lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

8. **What is event bubbling in JavaScript?**

   - Answer: Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM where events propagate from the deepest child element to its parents.

9. **What are JavaScript Promises and how do they work?**

   - Answer: JavaScript Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing for more manageable asynchronous code.

10. **Explain `async` and `await` in JavaScript.**

    - Answer: `async` and `await` are syntactical features in JavaScript that allow you to work with promises in a more synchronous manner.

11. **What is the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

12. **How do you create a class in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: Classes in JavaScript are a special syntax for its prototype-based OOP pattern, where you use the `class` keyword to define a class.

13. **What are template literals in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions and multi-line strings, using back-ticks (`).

14. **How do you handle exceptions in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: Exceptions in JavaScript are handled using `try...catch` blocks.

15. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**

    - Answer: `let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression they are used in. `const` is a signal that the identifier won’t be reassigned. `var` is function-scoped.

16. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

17. **Explain the spread operator in JavaScript.**

    - Answer: The spread operator `...` allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.

18. **What are JavaScript modules?**

    - Answer: JavaScript modules are individual files or scripts that can be imported into other JavaScript files, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

19. **What is the importance of callbacks in JavaScript?**

    - Answer: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after some operation has been completed, thus helping in asynchronous operations.

20. **How does the `map()` function work in JavaScript?**
    - Answer: The `map()` function creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

### Additional React Questions

6. **How do you handle forms in React?**

   - Answer: Forms in React can be handled using controlled components, where form data is handled by the React component's state.

7. **What is a PureComponent in React?**

   - Answer: A PureComponent is a type of component that does a shallow comparison on its state and props to decide if the component should re-render.

8. **Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.**

   - Answer: Lifting state up involves moving the shared state to their closest common ancestor in the component tree to keep the components in sync.

9. **What are fragments in React?**

   - Answer: Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

10. **How does React use keys in lists?**

    - Answer: Keys are used in React to uniquely identify list items in repetitive components, helping in efficient rendering and re-rendering of lists.

11. **What is React Router?**

    - Answer: React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables navigation among views of various components in a React Application.

12. **How do you optimize React applications?**
    - Answer: React applications can be optimized using techniques like memoization, lazy loading components, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## Props in React

In React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, **"props"** is a concept referring to the arguments passed into React components. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Here are some examples of props in React:

### Basic Text Props

Passing simple string data to a component.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

<Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

Props for User Data
Passing an object to a component to display user information.

jsx
Copy code
function UserProfile(props) {
return (
<div>
<h1>{props.user.name}</h1>
<p>Email: {props.user.email}</p>
</div>
);
}

const user = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'johndoe@example.com' };
<UserProfile user={user} />
Props for Event Handling
Passing a function as a prop to handle events.

jsx
Copy code
function Button(props) {
return <button onClick={props.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}

function handleButtonClick() {
console.log('Button clicked');
}

<Button handleClick={handleButtonClick} />
Children Prop
Special prop for passing children elements directly into a component.

jsx
Copy code
function Card(props) {
return <div className="card">{props.children}</div>;
}

<Card>
  <h1>This is a card</h1>
  <p>This is some card content.</p>
</Card>
Props for Styling
Passing style-related data.

jsx
Copy code
function AlertBox(props) {
return <div style={{ color: props.color }}>{props.message}</div>;
}

<AlertBox color="red" message="This is an error!" />
