# Frontend Developer Interview Questions

## JavaScript Questions

1. **What is JavaScript?**

   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used for building dynamic web applications.

2. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**

   - JavaScript has six primitive data types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `symbol`, along with the `object` type for more complex data structures.

3. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

   - `null` is an intentional absence of any value, while `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

4. **Explain closures in JavaScript.**

   - Closures are functions that remember the variables from the outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

5. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` for variable declaration?**

   - `let` and `const` have block scope, while `var` has function scope. `const` variables cannot be reassigned after declaration, but `let` and `var` can.

6. **How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?**

   - You can use callbacks, Promises, or async/await to handle asynchronous operations.

7. **Explain the event delegation pattern.**

   - Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements to efficiently manage events on those elements.

8. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

   - `null` is an intentional absence of any value, while `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

9. **What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**

   - Arrow functions are more concise function expressions introduced in ES6. They don't have their `this` context and cannot be used as constructors.

10. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**

    - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.

11. **What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?**

    - The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically.

12. **What is event bubbling and event capturing in the DOM?**

    - Event bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root of the DOM tree. Event capturing is the reverse, where the event starts from the root and trickles down to the target.

13. **How can you prevent the default behavior of an event in JavaScript?**

    - You can use the `event.preventDefault()` method to prevent the default behavior of an event.

14. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

    - `==` is a loose equality operator that checks for equality after type coercion, while `===` is a strict equality operator that checks for equality without type coercion.

15. **What is a callback function?**

    - A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some asynchronous operation is completed.

16. **Explain the concept of the same-origin policy in JavaScript.**

    - The same-origin policy is a security measure that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain for security reasons.

17. **What is the purpose of the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects in JavaScript?**

    - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are used to store key-value pairs in a web browser, but `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed, while `sessionStorage` only lasts for the duration of a page session.

18. **What is a promise in JavaScript?**

    - A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

19. **Explain the concept of the Event Loop in JavaScript.**

- The Event Loop is a core component of JavaScript's concurrency model, responsible for handling asynchronous operations and callbacks.

20. **What are async/await in JavaScript, and how do they work?**

- `async/await` is a syntax feature in JavaScript used for working with asynchronous code in a more synchronous style. The `async` keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of a function until a Promise is resolved. It makes asynchronous code easier to read and maintain.

21. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

    - The `this` keyword refers to the current execution context and can vary depending on how a function is called (e.g., method, constructor, global function).

22. **How can you clone an object in JavaScript?**

    - You can clone an object using methods like `Object.assign()`, the spread operator `{ ... }`, or libraries like Lodash.

23. **What is the purpose of the `bind()` method in JavaScript?**

    - The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has a specified `this` value and prepends any provided arguments to the original function.

24. **What are the different ways to include JavaScript in an HTML file?**
    - You can include JavaScript in HTML using `<script>` tags in the document's head or body, inline JavaScript within HTML elements, or by linking external JavaScript files using the `src` attribute.

## React Questions

1. **What is React?**

   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook.

2. **What are the key features of React?**

   - React features include a virtual DOM, component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, and JSX (JavaScript XML) for declarative UI.

3. **Explain the Virtual DOM in React.**

   - The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the DOM and optimizing updates.

4. **What is JSX in React?**

   - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. React components use JSX to describe what the UI should look like.

5. **What is a component in React?**

   - A component is a reusable and self-contained piece of UI that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. Components can be functional or class-based.

6. **What is the difference between a functional component and a class component in React?**

   - Functional components are simpler and use functional syntax, while class components have additional features like state and lifecycle methods.

7. **What is state in React?**

   - State is a built-in object in React components used to store and manage component-specific data that can change over time.

8. **Explain the concept of props in React.**

   - Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to its child components. They are read-only and help in component communication.

9. **What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in React?**

   - The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components in React. It allows you to declare and manage state variables.

10. **What is the React Router, and why is it used?**

    - React Router is a popular library for adding client-side routing to React applications, enabling the creation of single-page applications with multiple views or pages.

11. **What are lifecycle methods in React, and why are they important?**

    - Lifecycle methods are special methods that are called automatically during different phases of a component's life cycle. They are used for tasks like initialization, rendering, and cleanup.

12. **What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in React?**

    - The `useEffect` hook is used for handling side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and more.

13. **Explain the concept of controlled components in React forms.**

    - Controlled components are React form elements whose values are controlled by React state. This allows React to manage the form's data and behavior.

14. **What is the context API in React, and how is it used for state management?**

    - The context API is a built-in feature for sharing state between components without prop drilling. It's often used for global state management.

15. **What are React keys, and why are they important in lists?**

    - React keys are special attributes used to identify elements in a list. They help React efficiently update the DOM when items are added, removed, or reordered in a list.

16. **What is Redux, and when would you use it with React?**

    - Redux is a state management library for managing global application state in a predictable and maintainable way. It is often used with complex React applications.

17. **What is the purpose of the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in a class component?**

    - `componentDidMount` is called after a component has been added to the DOM. It's commonly used for data fetching and setup operations.

18. **Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs) in React.**

    - Higher-order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component with additional functionality.

19. **What is React Fiber, and how does it improve performance?**

    - React Fiber is a reconciliation algorithm introduced in React 16 that improves the ability to interrupt and prioritize rendering updates, leading to smoother user interfaces.

20. **What is lazy loading in React, and why is it useful?**

    - Lazy loading is a technique for deferring the loading of certain parts of a web application until they are needed, reducing the initial load time.

21. **What are React hooks, and why were they introduced?**

    - React hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making it easier to reuse logic and share stateful behavior.

22. **What is the purpose of the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method in a class component?**

    - `shouldComponentUpdate` allows you to control whether a component should re-render when its state or props change, improving performance.

23. **Explain the concept of server-side rendering (SSR) in React.**

    - Server-side rendering is a technique in which React components are rendered on the server and sent as HTML to the client, improving initial load times and SEO.

24. **What is the React DevTools extension, and how can it help developers?**

    - React DevTools is a browser extension that allows developers to inspect and debug React components and their state in real-time.

25. **What are React hooks, and why were they introduced?**
    - React hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making it easier to reuse logic and share stateful behavior.
